`react-contextual` is a tiny (~1KB) helper around [React 16's new context API](https://github.com/acdlite/rfcs/blob/new-version-of-context/text/0000-new-version-of-context.md).

It provides two things:

* consuming (and creating) context with ease, every kind of context, no matter which or whose or how many providers
* a minimal redux-like store pattern with setState semantics and central actions

# Why

Reacts new API for dynamic context distribution is built on render props. While it is very powerful it may be a little too low-level due to nesting and efficiency. `react-contextual` maps context values to component props, similar to how Redux operates. That takes cares of nesting and allows you to render only when necessary. It also provides a small store for state distribution. It could well be [the smallest flux-store yet](https://github.com/drcmda/react-contextual/blob/master/src/store.js). `react-contextual` also takes care of context creation, which is harder with the default api due to the singleton pattern.

# Installation

    npm install react-contextual

# How to use ...

```js
import { subscribe, Subscribe, Provider, namedContext } from 'react-contextual'
```

1. `subscribe(providers, selector)(AnyComponent)`

    Higher-order component to consume context. `providers` points to one or many contexts (can be context objects, string-id's, or functions that take component props and return a context object). `selector` maps the provider values into component props. Ommit `providers` and it will use `react-contextual`'s own context for the store (the one down below, number 3 in this list). Ommit `selector` and it will default to `props => props`, so all the contexts props will be merged to the wrapped components props.

2. `<Subscribe to={providers} select={selector}>{renderFunction}</Subscribe>`

    The same as above as a component that passes selected props via render function.

3. `<Provider initialState={state} actions={actions}>...</Provider>`

    A small store with central actions.

4. `namedContext(contextName, initialState)(AnyComponent)`

    Higher-order component that creates and injects a named context into the component you wrap. It will remove the context itself when it unmounts. `contextName` can either be a string id or a function that returns a string id, for instance `props => props.id`.

# If you just need a light-weight no-frills store

Provide state and actions, wrap everything that is supposed to access or mutate it within. Actions can be simple merges, functions, or async functions.

Example 2: https://codesandbox.io/s/lxly45lvkl (async actions)

### With decorator

But use with care as the spec may still change any time!

### What about multiple stores?

You can have as many as you like, just name them. `subscribe` also accepts your keys.

# If you are dealing with context providers of any kind

`subscribe` helps you to consume *any* React context. Soon libs like react-router, redux, etc. will likely start serving context. Look into the examples to see how easy it is to create a context provider in order to distribute dynamic data.

# If you like to create unique context providers

Reacts default api works with singletons, that makes it tough to create multi-purpose, nestable providers. Use the `namedContext` HOC to fix it. `subscribe` can also accept a function, so you can pass one or many dynamic context objects.

Example: https://codesandbox.io/s/m7q5z407p9

# If you like to consume context but dislike HOCs

Use `<Subscribe to={} select={}/>` to do the same as above with render props.

Example 1: https://codesandbox.io/s/wo28o5y1y5 (Multiple providers)

Example 2: https://codesandbox.io/s/ko1nz4j2r (Store as default provider)
